Oh, don't ask me.

175
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:21,430
I'm serious.

176
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,516
This time I'm really gonna hang up
the lifting belt.

177
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,810

178
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,144
Now when is Emma getting here?

179
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,979
Soon. She had to go pick up Carter.

180
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,731
His car's in the shop again.

181
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,986
You know, a real man can fix his own car.

182
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:39,281
Luke, get it out of your system
before he gets here. I'm warning you.

183
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,785
I'll try, but for your sake, not his.

184
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:47,540
<i>Attento!</i> I don't like her up there,
Bartholomew. Please be careful.

185
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,666
Romi.

186
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,543
I want Pee-Pa.

187
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,797
Your wish is Battle Cat's command, Romance.

188
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:55,923
- Oh!

189
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,635
She doesn't like that.
She likes "Romi."

190
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,011
- Right.
-  Mm-hm.

191
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,597
-  I missed you.
-  I missed you too.

192
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,933
I brought you
a little gift from my trip, okay?

193
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,059
Okay.

194
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,604
- Ta-da.
- Wow.

195
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,941
You hide this in your jewelry box,
and when you're 18 years old,

196
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,985
I'll get you a really beautiful gift, okay?

197
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,946
- Love you.
-  Love you too.

198
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:22,700
That is a Congolese warlord's diamond.
It's supposed to go into evidence.

199
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,826
It was just one.

200
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,245
-  Sorry we're late.
-  Hey, there we are.

201
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,122
-  What's all this?
- Emma.

202
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,625
- Dad.
<i>- Schatzel.</i>

203
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,628
- Oh, I missed you.

204
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,005
I missed you too.

205
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,092
Now you're leaving.

206
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,678
I know,
but for even better reasons than before.

207
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:45,222
I lobbied the governing body
of La Guajira,

208
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,433
and I just learned
they accepted our program.

209
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,769
So fresh water
to five times as many Colombians.

210
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,645
Wow, that is fantastic.

211
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,522
- Congratulations.

212
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,399
They should call her the aqueduct.

213
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,113
'Cause she delivers the water.

214
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,912
- Are you ready to be blown away?
- Okay.

215
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:08,954
- Stay right here.
- Okay.

216
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,080
Okay? All right.

217
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,918
- I'm sorry.
- I thought it was funny.

218
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,127
- I laughed.
- Thank you.

219
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,587
Surprise.

220
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,214
Wow.

221
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,382
Oh, um... Ow!

222
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,675
-  You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

223
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,302
- Your shoulder okay?
- Yeah.

224
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:27,014
Yeah, it's fine.
I, um, I messed it up roller skating.

225
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,683
But I can still open presents.

226
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:34,021
It's a stand-up mixer
for the Sunday Funday bake-offs.

227
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:37,233
- Like the good old days, huh?
- Dad, I love it.

228
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,859
And I love you.

229
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:42,696
You always got straight A's,
first chair violin,

230
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:45,324
no smoking, no drinking, no cursing.

231
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,911
And now you're providing water
to millions more people.

232
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,622
It's one more reason
to be so proud of you.

233
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,332
But I have to tell ya,

234
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,460
I'm a little bit concerned
about this La Guajira.

235
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,380
- It's a very volatile area.
- How do you know about that?

236
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,299
My daughter says she's going to Colombia,
I Googled it.

237
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:07,012
Um, actually, the Global Fund has them
in a very secure location, Mr. Brunner,

238
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:11,517
um, and, statistically, most kidnappings
tend to be of American men.

239
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,269
That's great. Then you should go with her.

240
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,311
Luke...

241
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:17,314
I would absolutely love to,
but I gotta stay here and work.

242
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:20,401
Yeah, kindergarten teacher.
Those paintings don't finger themselves.

243
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,318
Dad.

244
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:23,237
Seriously? No crunchies?

245
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,281
It's not cake time yet, Barry.

246
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,449
One slice, Uncle Barry. Your heart.

247
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,451
It's the recital all over again.

248
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,204
This cake is bullshit.

249
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,582
Dad, I'll be fine.

250
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:38,586
And I hope you know,
I couldn't have done this without you.

251
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,087
Hm.

252
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,049
You've always encouraged me
and taught me to reach beyond my grasp,

253
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,050
and...

254
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,804
I didn't get here by myself.

255
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:55,686
I have a great idea. I'll go to the store
and get some cupcake mix,

256
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,521
and we break in the mixer.

257
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,523
- Chocolate fudge swirl?
- I'll be right back, okay?

258
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,025
- Okay.

259
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:06,155
I told him you wanted
a mortar and pestle to make Indian food.

260
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,074
- He doesn't listen.

261
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,869
- One of the many reasons I divorced him.

262
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:17,541
- Yeah, but he always tries his best.
- Yeah.

263
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,752
I love it, 'cause it's from him.

264
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:33,265
<i>♪ What a fool believes... ♪</i>

265
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:34,642
Mm.

266
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,268
I know, it's good.

267
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,730
So how are you gonna spend
your golden years, huh?

268
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,191
- Lots of mall walking?
- Learning the Facebook?

269
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,360
Getting vaccinated
for pneumococcal pneumonia?

270
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,778
Wilford Brimley Film Festival.

271
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,279
Are you gonna campaign
for Grover Cleveland?

272
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,073
You want to know what I've planned?

273
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,450
Here. Look at this.

274
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,120
The Oden 410.
You know, from the sting in Panama?

275
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,038
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

276
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,207
Well, the CIA said I can have it.

277
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,418
They gave that to you?
I couldn't get a humidifier for my office.

278
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:05,965
Tally and I, we've talked about sailing
around the world together for ages.

279
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,343
Now since I'm retired,
what's gonna stop us?

280
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:12,096
- Fifteen-year-old divorce papers?
- She doesn't love you anymore?

281
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,973
The job's why we got divorced.

282
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,892
All the lies,
leaving in a moment's notice,

283
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,310
never having been around.

284
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,646
The CIA destroys relationships.

285
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:24,733
I've been waiting for a decade and a half
to win my wife back.

286
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:28,862
Tally and I, we're gonna make love
deckside before the summer is over.

287
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:31,281
Hm. I will never step foot on that boat.

288
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,908
It's not a boat. It's a ship.

289
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,661
- Luke, can I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.

290
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:40,124
Hey, Aldon, Roo,
feel free to visit me at the marina.

291
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,668
You can scrape the barnacles
off my dinghy.

292
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,585
Ew.

293
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,005
- He's toast.
- Yeah.

294
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,591
That man survived a Russian mob hit,
but that Tally plan is gonna kill him.

295
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:53,303
And if it does,
I'm totally going after his ex.

296
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:54,555
Same.

297
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:58,684
If this is about the crunchies,
I swear to you, I ordered them.

298
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,149
We're gonna lose an operative.

299
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,234
- Who?
- Code name's Panda.

300
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,986
Been embedded in Guyana for a while now.

301
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,615
with Lape Pa Lanmo.

302
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,244
Remember this friendly face?

303
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,328
Omar Polonia?

304
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:21,790
I killed that son of a bitch 25 years ago
in Operation Jungle Book.

305
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,500
Not him, his son.

306
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,668
Boro?

307
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,962
Seems Papa's death motivated him.

308
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:29,339
Dedicated his life
to finishing what Daddy started.

309
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:33,218
That's impossible. I got him into
a boarding school in London.

310
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,554
- I know.
- He was going to study business.

311
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,849
He was going to be different than his dad.

312
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,184
You got half of what you wanted.

313
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,144
Graduated high school at 16,

314
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,562
Oxford at 20,

315
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,272
MBA from Wharton at 22,

316
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,399
all geared towards funding,
continuing and growing

317
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,735
what's left of his father's
paramilitary organization.

318
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,529
Lape Pa Lanmo now has over 400 members,

319
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:55,824
many living on his compound,
completely devoted to Boro,

320
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,993
the son of their fallen leader,

321
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,788
and to his cause of augmenting
their wealth, power, and influence

322
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,247
through illegal arms sales.

323
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,335
Specifically, with this suitcase nuke.

324
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,713
Complete with the reflector beryllium
to reduce fissile material mass,

325
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:10,631
thereby making it...

326
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:13,550
A WMD that can be taken anywhere,

327
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,345
and now Boro pulled it off.

328
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,973
Parental murder seems to be
quite the inspirational tool.

329
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,768
It's not my fault that the kid went south.

330
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,645
I even waited for him
to get off the compound

331
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,730
before I threw his father off the cliff.

332
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:28,690
Trying to be nice.

333
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,901
Boro has a man Troy.

334
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,445
He's in Yemen
meeting a potential bidder for the nuke.

335
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,947
Seems Boro's gonna hold an auction,

336
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,573
where the world's biggest and baddest

337
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,826
are gonna try to get their hands
on his weapon.

338
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,370
Intel says Troy's ascertained
Panda as a plant.

339
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,038
- Then pull the officer.
- We can't.

340
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,373
We've lost communication<i>,</i>

341
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:48,168
and since Boro forbids calls
from the Middle East for security reasons,

342
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:51,713
we have 36 hours till Troy's back
in Guyana and exposes Panda.

343
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:54,133
We need someone Boro already trusts

344
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,801
to get in his camp immediately.

345
00:18:58,762 --> 00:18:59,847
We need Finn Hoss.

346
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,014
Oh, no way.

347
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,683
Boro doesn't know Finn killed his old man.

348
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,561
He'll welcome the rich European mercenary,

349
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,937
his childhood hero,

350
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,857
the man who looked out for him
with open arms.

351
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:10,858
I said no.

352
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,025
Whoa, wait.

353
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:15,195
You'll represent bidders who paid more
for the WMD than anyone else.

354
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:18,282
You zip in, extract Panda,
grab the WMD, zip on out.

355
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:21,493
You tell HQ I'm retired.
That's it, and that's all.

356
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,372
This is coming from WH HQ.

357
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,061
<i>Patsy's Pastrami Palace.
How may I help you?</i>

358
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,063
Yeah, I'm confirming a party platter.

359
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,692
Order number XK742.

360
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,905
<i>Yes, sir, that order's confirmed.</i>

361
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,991
<i>It's very hot, and needs to be delivered
as soon as possible.</i>

362
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,162
Damn it.

363
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,043
My ship.

364
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,296
Tally.

365
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:20,302
Hey pal, uh, I am 100% Team Luke.

366
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,803
Screw Team Donnie.

367
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,681
I promise your ship
will be waiting for you when you get back,

368
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,226
and Operation Life with Wife is a go.

369
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,353
What's Team Donnie?

370
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,897
What? Oh, I didn't say that.

371
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,484
I have a thousand ways to wreck your life,

372
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,402
and you wouldn't even know it was me.

373
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:43,158
That guy, Donatello, from Tally's office?

374
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:44,868
They're dating.

375
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,746
I saw them at Color Me Mine
a few months ago,

376
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:48,997
and I promised I wouldn't tell you.

377
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,082
Judas.

378
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,751
If you were distracted in the field,
you could've gotten hurt.

379
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,795
I was gonna tell you
as soon as your retirement was official,

380
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,547
but then HQ said
they needed to pull you back into Guyana.

381
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,049
Give me the damn file.

382
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:08,016
Roo and Aldon will be on standby
in case anything goes sideways.

383
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,477
And for what it's worth,
Donnie's snowman mug sucked.

384
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,855
Snowmen ain't purple.

385
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,329
<i>♪ I'm gonna die alone ♪</i>

386
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,123
<i>♪ Really alone ♪</i>

387
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,542
<i>♪ I'm gonna die alone ♪</i>

388
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,045
<i>♪ I'm gonna die alone</i>... <i>♪</i>

389
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,381
That's Cain Khan, Boro's number two.

390
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,092
<i>Be careful, he's tough.</i>

391
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,303
{\an8} <i>Doesn't look that tough.</i>

392
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,471
He clearly waxes his eyebrows.
Real men tweeze.

393
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,639
- No messing around.
- I'm not.

394
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,308
B Team's job is to observe and report.

395
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,935
I am observing
a physical characteristic of a target.

396
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:54,896
And I'm reporting he looks fabulous.

397
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,565
Like a Latino Zac Efron.

398
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,317
You can do Euclidean geometry,

399
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,902
but you can't figure out
it's not time to poke the bear.

400
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:03,530
- Do you consider yourself the bear?
- Maybe like a baby bear.

401
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,532
Swear to God, lock it up.

402
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,035
That's it, and that's all.

403
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:11,747
Finn Hoss,
I am Cain, Boro's first lieutenant.

404
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,207
- He awaits your arrival.
- Wonderful.

405
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,460
I didn't say you can go.

406
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:31,850
Boro knows you.

407
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,934
I do not.

408
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:35,604
<i>Vámonos</i>.

409
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,145
Oh, am I dreaming? I can't believe it.

410
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,480
- Boro.

411
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,484
I always wondered if I'd see you again.

412
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,736
Look at you, still a brick shithouse.

413
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,571
I still do the workouts you taught me.

414
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,324
Preachers, hammers,
curls for the girls, right?

415
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,493
Look at you, Der Bengal.

416
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,413
Der Bengal,
that's what he used to call me.

417
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,373
- The rascal.
- That's right.

418
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,459
Well, the rascal's done well for himself.

419
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,585
Well, thanks to you.

420
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,630
Everything fell apart after Papa died.

421
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,049
But you always watched over me.

422
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:48,260
You think I don't know
who was paying for my school?

423
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,804
All the care packages to England,
the peanut brittle?

424
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,765
Return addresses are dangerous
in my line of work, as you know.

425
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,934
I always knew you'd be there for me
if I needed you.

426
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:57,352
Come here.

427
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,730
You look so much like your father.

428
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,024
I really miss him.

429
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,279
I honor him by continuing his work

430
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,991
and hopefully doing business
with his dear friend, no?

431
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:11,950
Absolutely.

432
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,327
- When can I see the package?
- Yes.

433
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:17,831
I have a client who likes to avoid
all this auction nonsense

434
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,166
who'll blow you away with a big offer.

435
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,375
Of course.

436
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:24,588
But first, a tour of what I've built.

437
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,010
Quite an operation here.

438
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,637
I provide food, shelter, income,

439
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,600
and in return, my soldiers provide me
with unconditional loyalty.

440
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:39,436
We grow cinnamon, ginger, cacao,

441
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:43,315
the sale of which helps to launder
our extracurricular activities.

442
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:46,860
Me <i>no habla</i>.

443
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,571
Translate that Español, Mr. Linguistics.

444
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,072
It's not Spanish, it's Quechua.

445
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:52,199
What did he say?

446
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,743
He asked his pal if he wanted
to go shooting with him later.

447
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:58,872
Hell, I wanna go shooting with him.
Our own soldiers don't have that gear yet.

448
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:03,376
Just thinking about firing
one of those off gives me a gusher.

449
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:04,753
I also spy with my Goldeneye

450
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,797
tattoos indicating
Ecuadorian Special Forces.

451
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,466
Means even the farm hands are dangerous.

452
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,842
Download me later, okay?

453
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,761
Things are about to get real intense

454
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:14,846
real soon.

455
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,891
Grossed low eight figures last year.

456
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:21,061
The bombs in the Manila airport, us.

457
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:25,273
The AK's in Ethiopia,
on both sides, was us.

458
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:26,900
Impressed is not the word.

459
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,193
When I sell my weapon,

460
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:32,322
the most dangerous and most easily
concealed weapon on Earth,

461
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,950
the world will know
I'm a man to be reckoned with.

462
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,453
Russia, China, America,
they will all have to address me.

463
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:40,914
They will call me Boro Polonia. Polonia.

464
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,209
The name of my father
will be in the mouths

465
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,961
of the world's most powerful men.

466
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,756
Then it will be like he is still alive.

467
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:58,348
Come.

468
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:00,433
The boys are blowing off steam.

469
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,484
Dani, come on!

470
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:10,569
Make a move!

471
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,154
Good, Dani's fighting.

472
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:19,077
Wow. Packs a big punch for a little guy.

473
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,370
Just remember,

474
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,247
<i>I love you, buddy.</i>

475
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,416
Dani is not a guy.

476
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,220
Holy shit.

477
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:40,640

Dani...

493
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:42,994
someone I'd like you to meet.

494
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:47,248
Finn Hoss, Danielle DeRosa,

495
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:48,625
a real life American soldier

496
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,961
that decided if she was gonna fight
for a living, she might as well get rich.

497
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,717
Nice to meet you.

498
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,429
I liked your shoulder trick.

499
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:03,431
Yeah,
I've been working on it for six months.

500
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,349
Careful.

501
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,227
I know someone
that hurt their shoulder rollerskating.

502
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:08,603
Never got better.

503
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,231
Dani, she's the toughest one
on the compound.

504
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:13,692
And Finn here,

505
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:17,070
this is the baddest man
my father ever knew.

506
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:20,031
I'm always envious
about the way you talk about your dad.

507
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,784
Probably 'cause mine was a filthy liar.

508
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,831
<i>General council meeting in the pavilion.</i>

509
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,916
- Duty calls.
- Of course.

510
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,835
Dani, can you finish showing Finn around?

511
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,921
Tonight, we celebrate your arrival.

512
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,424
- Tomorrow, we talk shop, eh?
- Yeah.

513
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:40,510
Come with me.

514
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,683
You better be here to sell Boro a Bowflex.

515
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,977
- Me? Where's the irrigation system?

516
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,603
Oh, and this is Colombia?

517
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:55,316
Barry, answer the goddamn phone.
I know you're hearing us over the comms.

518
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:04,617
You knew Luke Brunner's daughter
was a spook, and you didn't tell him?

519
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,078
You know that YouTube video

520
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,831
where a gorilla
goes to town on a cantaloupe?

521
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,499
You're the cantaloupe.

522
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,084
Why didn't you tell him she was Panda?

523
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,420
I couldn't have Luke walking in there
with his kid on his mind.

524
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,130
Any loss of focus could've got him killed.

525
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,174
Pretty sure he's unfocused now.

526
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,138
<i>My daughter's in the CIA?</i>

527
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,598
Hey, buddy.

528
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,807
<i>Uncle Barry?</i>

529
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:29,184
<i>Hi, pumpkin.</i>

530
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,393
What the fuck?!

531
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:33,646
Hey, watch your language.
Lower your voice.

532
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:37,108
First, we are a quarter mile
from the compound.

533
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:42,781
Second,
fuckity, fuck, fuck, asshole, fuck!

534
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,074
- I think she's upset.
<i>-</i> Dollar in the swear jar.

535
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:47,035
Everyone, please, let me talk.

536
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,496
Luke, when Emma
got into George Washington,

537
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,748
she was living so close
to CIA headquarters.

538
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,500
It was too tempting for The Farm.

539
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,460
HQ watched the kid grow up.

540
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:59,047
<i>Physical like you, smart like you,
so they set up a recruitment sting.</i>

541
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,591
<i>$200 for student testing
in the psych department,</i>

542
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:02,842
<i>and she took the bait.</i>

543
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:04,844
Highest score CIA's ever seen.

544
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:07,055
<i>Higher than yours, higher than mine,</i>

545
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,349
except she doesn't have a heart condition.

546
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,850
<i>You put my daughter in danger</i>

547
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,353
<i>because you couldn't handle the fact
that you couldn't do the job?</i>

548
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:18,149
Her recall, problem-solving skills,
straight-up IQ, off the charts.

549
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,734
<i>She was born to do this.</i>

550
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,277
She's Luke Brunner's kid.

551
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:24,113
<i>She took the job without hesitation
right after college.</i>

552
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:27,325
<i>Three years, CMO vault kept it
where you'd never cross paths.</i>

553
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,910
<i>Four years now in the field.</i>

554
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,079
Global Relief Fund is her Merry Fitness.

555
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,291
You guys are CIA officers?

556
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:39,254
<i>Yeah, for the last 40 years.</i>

557
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,005
<i>Uncle Barry for 17 years.</i>

558
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,340
Uncle Barry? What--

559
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,592
- Explain that to us.
-  Yeah, you're really young.

560
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:47,011
Started working with Luke when I was 21,
she was 11.

561
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,805
It stuck. And Black don't crack.

562
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,348
<i>Okay, how is this even doable?</i>

563
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,308
The CIA created a Chinese wall

564
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:55,562
so you'd never know
I or your dad worked for the company.

565
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:59,440
Set it up where we'd never cross paths,
which was near impossible

566
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,402
considering you both work
for the same regional office.

567
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:05,488
<i>Only a small number of people know
that both of you are on the job.</i>

568
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:07,031
<i>For the record, we did not know.</i>

569
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,700
What is he doing here?

570
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,118
You've been compromised.

571
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,662
Troy's gonna burn you
as soon as he lands at 4:00 a.m.

572
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:16,124
Your dad is there to extract you
and to retrieve the WMD.

573
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,041
<i>What?</i>

574
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:20,628
<i>I have been working this case,
sweating my ass off...</i>

575
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:21,546
<i>Language.</i>

576
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,215
<i>...and he's gonna-- Gonna extract me?</i>

577
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,134
The hell are you so mad about?

578
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,219
I should be mad at you.

579
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,597
You've been lying to me
for the last decade.

580
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:33,266
And you smoke.

581
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,851
A decade?

582
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,771
- You've been lying to me my whole life.

583
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,773
That's it, and that's all.

584
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:49,198
She just "that's it, and that's all'd" me.

585
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:54,329
Who the hell was that out there?

586
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:57,540
"How does my ass taste?"
I mean, who the hell talks like that?

587
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,418
Luke, Emma often does what she wants

588
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,337
<i>when she wants, how she wants,</i>

589
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,963
and doesn't always listen when she should.

590
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:06,132
'Cause she clearly has daddy issues.

591
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:09,469
How could you pull my daughter
into this world?

592
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,137
<i>The brass was infatuated with her,</i>

593
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:14,307
and they threatened me with felony treason
if I leaked her identity to anyone,

594
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,308
including you.

595
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,644
<i>My ulcers and intestinal issues?</i>

596
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:18,937
This is why.

597
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,856
Your intestinal issues is because
you eat all the Sour Patch crap.

598
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:25,401
Hey, bottom line, the guy who's gonna
expose Emma lands at 4:00 a.m.

599
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:26,611
He needs to be dealt with.

600
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,906
But first, I have to go to the party
that Boro's throwing for me.

601
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:31,699
We'll talk later.

602
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,871
I thought you were my friend, Barry.

603
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,083
-  He's emotional.

604
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,751
He didn't mean that.

605
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,169
Yeah.

606
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:46,422
Listen, Boro is throwing the party
for everyone, not just Luke.

607
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:47,340
Yeah.

608
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,051
He totally meant that part
about not being friends though.

609
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,844
- That sucks.
- That does suck.

610
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:56,140
<i>♪ We're gonna have a good time tonight ♪</i>

611
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,309
<i>♪ Let's celebrate ♪</i>

612
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,520
<i>♪ It's all right ♪</i>

613
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:05,984
<i>♪ Celebrate good times, come on ♪</i>

614
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:14,242
<i>♪ Celebrate good times, come on ♪</i>

615
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:20,540
Excuse me.

616
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,673
That was great, right? Come on.

617
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:34,637
It is a night to celebrate, no?

618
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,640
Because my father's dear friend,

619
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,518
a man who was like a second dad to me--

620
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:44,272
I mean, he taught me to drive on this
very compound when I was just a boy.

621
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,775
An ally to Lape Pa Lanmo
when we were first growing

622
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,444
and an ally today.

623
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:53,406
Everyone, Finn Hoss.

624
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,627
When my father needed resources
to grow our flock,

625
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:08,838
Finn was there to help.

626
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,132
Out of love...

627
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:13,342
out of loyalty.

628
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:16,596
And, while on the subject of loyalty,

629
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:19,891
I want to single out
one of our longest serving soldiers,

630
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,685
Jacomo Negrino.

631
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,771
Get up here, Jaco, come on.

632
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:28,691
Yeah.

633
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:30,693
Yes, there he is.

634
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:38,618
Jacomo has been part of our family
for over 15 years.

635
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:43,706
Moving product,
helping expand our territory,

636
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:46,709
watching every penny.

637
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,338
So the only question I have is...

638
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:53,508
where's the money?

639
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:03,768
I don't understand.

640
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,688
Where's my money, Jaco?

641
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,149
This is not good.

642
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:12,985
You manage it all.

643
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:15,238
Where's the money from the last sale?
It's gone.

644
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:18,491
I never touched it.
I would never steal from you.

645
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,450
Boro, no!

646
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:38,928
This is what happens...
when you betray our family.

647
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,225
Music.

648
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:49,981
Come on, music.

649
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:02,368
<i>♪ Don't go changing ♪</i>

650
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:05,830
<i>♪ Trying to please me ♪</i>

651
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:09,625
<i>♪ You never-- ♪</i>

652
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:13,129
Christ, Barry,
Boro makes Jim Jones like Jim Henson.

653
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,089
His profile did indicate
some irrationality.

654
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:17,884
He just opened up a man's head
after a Kool & the Gang song.

655
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:20,761
- His profile indicated that?
- No, that was a surprise.

656
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:23,347
So we're dealing with a high IQ
paranoid megalomaniac,

657
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,807
which is a bad combination

658
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,893
when we have two undercovers
we're trying to hide.

659
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,978
- You gotta put us in.
- There are risks to rushing in.

660
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:31,272
There are risks to playing
Little Miss Muffet too.

661
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,565
Just let me think.

662
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,068
I'm not gonna let anything happen
to the Brunners.

663
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,320
And how are you so certain?

664
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:41,282
Because family means no one
gets left behind or forgotten.

665
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,327
That's from <i>Lilo & Stitch</i>.

666
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:45,912
Kiss my ass.

667
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,288
Now, that's from <i>Frozen</i>.

668
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,711
Taking an interest in Miss DeRosa, I see.

669
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,172
Oh no. I'm an old man.

670
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,548
Oh, you're Finn Hoss.

671
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,675
My father said you invented a way

672
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:02,720
to slit a man's throat vertically
so he bleeds out faster.

673
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,557
You can do that, a girl's no challenge.

674
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,768
Your father also tell you
how much money I made for him?

675
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,436
I can do the same for you.

676
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:13,814
Just show me that suitcase
everyone in Europe is talking about.

677
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:18,069
Never get so busy making a living
you forget to make a life.

678
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:19,820
You taught me that.

679
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,322
Tomorrow, we work.

680
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,617
Tonight, go to Dani.

681
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:27,495
She's worth it.

682
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,330
I speak from experience.

683
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:34,835
<i>♪ Don't change the color of your hair ♪</i>

684
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,298

- I turned off the comms with Barry.
- Why?

693
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,253
Well, we may have to improvise,
and the CIA doesn't like that.

694
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,465
You know that British guy, the redhead?

695
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:23,634
William. What about him?

696
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:24,969
He slipped me a note.

697
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:29,223
He knows... that Finn Hoss
is a gun for hire.

698
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:32,601
He offered me money
to get his family and him out of here.

699
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,062
- He's terrified of this place.
- No.

700
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:38,065
- What do you mean, just "no"?
- No.

701
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:40,401
He's been here longer than almost anybody.

702
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,111
His kid was raised here.

703
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,404
It could be a trap.

704
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,948
He also could be a dad
that is scared for his family.

705
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:48,617
I'm sorry
if I don't have much faith

706
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:50,328
in the family concept right now.

707
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,831
No. You think it was easy to do
what I was doing with a family?

708
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,751
Trying to keep the marriage together?

709
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,754
You will find out for yourself...
the hard way.

710
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:04,050
We don't have time for this.

711
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,219
Troy lands in seven hours,
and then I'm dead.

712
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:09,263
We have to cover miles
through the woods tonight.

713
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:12,767
If we leave by 2:00 a.m.,
that gives us enough time

714
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,727
and lessens odds of us being seen.

715
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,229
Remember, I'm the senior officer here.

716
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,942
You got me word I'm compromised.
Your job is done.

717
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,736
I know the play for handling Troy.

718
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,279
I know where the WMD is stored,

719
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:27,615
so follow me or get out of my way.

720
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:30,201
<i>♪ ...promise from my heart ♪</i>

721
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:38,250
<i>♪ I couldn't love you any better ♪</i>

722
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:58,687
I think a farmer must've hit it.

723
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:01,440
You grab the horns,
and I'll grab the legs.

724
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:24,505
You could have just hid in the bushes.

725
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:28,467
I didn't know
who was gonna make the pickup.

726
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:31,262
Could have weighed
150 pounds more than me.

727
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,390
Element of surprise, this was the move.

728
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,225
Here, clean up and change.

729
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,853
We gotta load up the bodies
and move the cow.

730
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,688
Oh really? I thought we'd leave them here.

731
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:41,897
What?

732
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:43,691
Nothing.

733
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:48,279
<i>During your little scuffle,
comms fell off and your camera broke.</i>

734
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,073
<i>I'm not comfortable
with you doing the rest of this blind.</i>

735
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:54,285
It's not like I can run around
the compound with a cell phone in my hand.

736
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,328
I'll touch base with you later, okay?

737
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:57,955
Easy.

738
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,332
- I should have driven.
- Oh really?

739
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:02,751
Do we have to talk about
Mrs. Bernstein's cockapoo?

740
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,629
Maybe I wouldn't have hit Rosco

741
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:09,258
if you'd squeezed some driving lessons
for me in between all of Boro's.

742
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:12,386
I killed the kid's father,
so I felt guilty.

743
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:13,929
You killed Boro's dad?

744
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,640
Shit, how many kids have you screwed up?

745
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,519
Troy's back.

746
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:22,813
Go faster.
It's a bad idea to keep him waiting.

747
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,356
Well, talking about bad ideas,

748
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:26,817
what were you thinking sleeping with Boro?

749
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,653
What? I didn't sleep with that creep.

750
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:30,571
Good.

751
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,407
Now, you know I'm not too fond of Carter,

752
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,659
but if you're really getting serious,

753
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:40,706
you should enter marriage... before you...

754
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,124
What?

755
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,584
Nothing.

756
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:47,087
- Do you think I'm a virgin?
- Let me think what I want to think.

757
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:48,380
Oh my God, I'm 28.

758
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,425
All right, I'm old-fashioned.
When I got married, it felt special

759
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:53,427
that I was the only man
your mother's been with.

760
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:56,514
- Well, not anymore.
- What are you talking about?

761
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:03,062
Been divorced 15 years.
What'd you think would happen?

762
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,855
You're talking about
that schmuck Donatello?

763
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:05,856
Yep.

764
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,484
You're my daughter.
You're supposed to tell me those things.

765
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:09,401
Tell you what?

766
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:12,655
There was an Italian guy from accounting
giving Mom the old "sausich"?

767
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,323
That son of a bitch.

768
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:17,243
What does she see in that loser?

769
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,411
Maybe the fact that he's actually around.

770
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,707
Well, you know why I haven't been around.

771
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,963
Why do all the women in my life
have terrible taste in men?

772
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,381
Carter is sweet.

773
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,383
He's kind and gentle...

774
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:36,011
...and reliable.

775
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:36,971
And so is Donnie.

776
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,515
Gee, wonder why Mom and I
are attracted to guys like that now.

777
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:44,186
- Okay, now what?
- Suck it up.

778
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:45,354
Mom likes the guy.

779
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,939
No, I'm talking about the bodies.

780
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,733
You want to run the show?
Then run the damn show.

781
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,945
Fine. We throw 'em in the back
and ditch 'em in the rice paddies.

782
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:55,030
It's off-season.
No one goes there this time of year.

783
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,993
Double-time. Rain'll slow us.

784
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,035
Hey.

785
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:01,495
I'm sorry I cursed.

786
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,331
Dad, I don't give a shit.

787
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:17,052
Nuke's kept here in the north acreage,
away from the rest of the compound.

788
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:20,055
Best way there is through this stretch.
No one will see us.

789
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:22,349
- Set up?
- Steel construction Quonset hut.

790
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:27,354
Four guards, one at each compass point,
rotate every five hours.

791
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:29,231
All have AKs and MP7s.

792
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:30,983
But I've got one too,

793
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:34,111
and they can't shoot like I can.

794
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,156
They don't know I have this.

795
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,407
Where did you get that?

796
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:40,659
Black market in town.

797
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:43,245
I started skimming cash
as soon as they assigned me admin detail.

798
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,956
So Jacomo got killed
because you were stealing?

799
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:48,042
Apparently.

800
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,338
What? Jacomo was helping Boro
sell illegal weapons.

801
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,427
- What's that?
- The Charter Arms Pink Lady.

802
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:01,513
Small, easiest thing I could smuggle in
when I first got here.

803
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,392
Well, I think I should have the automatic.

804
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:07,311
I set the marksmanship score for my class.

805
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:10,773
So did I. And who knows even
if you're gonna be sober?

806
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,858
I mean, is this how I raised you?

807
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:14,026
Alcohol?

808
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:15,736
Cigarettes?

809
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:18,280
- And a garish lipstick--
- That's not lipstick.

810
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,948
- Oh my God.

811
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:22,701
-  It's vibrating. My God.
- Kill me now.

812
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:23,619
Purell!

813
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,371
Stop touching my things. Oh my God.

814
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,872
Tidy up before your dad comes to visit.

815
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:29,166
I didn't know
you were gonna be here, remember?

816
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,877
Transport is gonna be
at the airstrip in 30.

817
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:33,712
Can we please just focus on the job?

818
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:34,630
Yes, please.

819
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,006
Good because we gotta get--

820
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,217
- My God.
- Oh my God.

821
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,551
It's still buzzing.

822
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,303
- Oh God.
- Jesus. Okay.

823
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:42,680
Okay. Okay.

824
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:45,015
It's off. It's off, okay? It's off.

825
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,893
God, why are you here?

826
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:58,112
I never knew you hated me that much.

827
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,284
I don't hate you,

828
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,204
but I have every right to be furious

829
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,957
now that I know that
what I suspected all along was right.

830
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:11,875
You suspected I was an operative?

831
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:15,671
No, that it was 100% your fault
you and Mom got divorced.

832
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:18,132
But, <i>Schatzel</i>, now you know
why I was gone so much.

833
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:21,927
I tried to convince myself, you know,
"Dad has to travel for work."

834
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:23,679
"He's a small businessman."

835
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:27,099
"Clearly a very bad small businessman,
but, you know...

836
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:30,728
he's doing his best."

837
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,524
I wanted to beg you to sell that company,

838
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:37,609
to stay home.

839
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:43,365
But, you know, family situation
was tense enough with Mom always so sad.

840
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:45,659
She was sad?

841
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:50,205
- I thought she was angry.
- You could have taken a desk job.

842
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:52,291
Analytics, logistics, training.

843
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:56,336
You could've been home.
But no, you didn't want a desk job,

844
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:59,548
you wanted to run around the world
doing cool, sexy cases.

845
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,925
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is. You know how I know?

846
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:04,136
Because I like doing cool, sexy cases.

847
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,804
Difference is, I don't have a family.

848
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,975
I did everything I could
to make you wanna stay with us.

849
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:12,144
Sports, violin...

850
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:14,438
...math competitions.

851
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:17,858
But you loved all of those things,
and you were so good at it.

852
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,902
I wasn't good. I was perfect.

853
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:21,779
I thought if I could do everything right,

854
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:24,323
then no matter what
was going on with you and Mom...

855
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,534
How could you leave a perfect kid?

856
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:34,708
And now I'm an adult
still pretending to be perfect

857
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:38,295
because... I just got so goddamn used to it.

858
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,172
But you know what? That's-- It's great.

859
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:41,590
I'm so glad you know about my job

860
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:44,134
because now I can maybe
stop faking it in front of you.

861
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,721
- Sweetheart--
- No. We gotta get the suitcase ASAP.

862
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:50,140
Boro is gonna wake up,
he's gonna wonder where Troy is,

863
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,434
and it's not gonna take him
a long time to do the math.

864
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:54,311
Finn Hoss, get out here!

865
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:59,191
- What do you think that means?
- It means Boro's math homework's done.

866
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,948
Where were you last night?

867
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:09,451
Troy had an offer for our weapon
for millions, and now he's gone missing.

868
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:10,786
Who the hell is Troy?

869
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,079
I am a card player.

870
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,455
If we've never had a cheat in the game,

871
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:16,792
and money starts to go missing
when the new man sits at the table,

872
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:17,960
who do you think we suspect?

873
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,295
Usually,
the one who's doing all the talking.

874
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,172
Right now, you won't shut up.

875
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,966
I saw you exit the woods together.

876
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,052
I took your advice about Dani.

877
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,304
She is a tomcat.

878
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:31,223
That's why we were in the woods.

879
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:45,571
Maybe no one goes down
to the rice paddies this time of the year

880
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:46,905
because of all the flooding.

881
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:50,242
Sounds about right.

882
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:51,952
Move!

883
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,120
Move. Out of the way.

884
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:04,673
The cut on Marcos' neck,

885
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:06,550
is it vertical?

886
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:09,845
Finn!

887
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:13,098
Barry, we need an evac
at the airstrip now.

888
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:14,892
Go! Find them!

889
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,894
They do not leave this compound!

890
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,730
You find him, and you bring him to me. Go!

891
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,773
They do not leave this compound!

892
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:37,873
No. I slipped a note under his door
before we went after Troy.

893
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,004
- What if he's a loyalist to Boro?
- He would've shot us already.

894
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,422
They're not coming with us.

895
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:46,590
We're not with Boro.

896
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:49,426
They're getting close.
We've got to do this now.

897
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:52,137
I am so done doing things
just to please you.

898
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:55,432
I don't have my gun.

899
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,684
- I have to go hand-to-hand.
- No.

900
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:03,315
Barry, within 50 yards of our location,

901
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:05,192
there are probably
seven to eight cell phones.

902
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:08,278
The one with the weakest signal
will be wired to the nuke

903
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,155
and sheltered under a steel roof.

904
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:12,366
Fake an accelerated countdown sequence.

905
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,617
<i>On it.</i>

906
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:14,701
What are you doing?

907
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,370
Top of a hill,

908
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:20,082
there are two bulls that are looking down
at a bunch of beautiful cows.

909
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:21,833
The younger says to the older,

910
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:24,795
"Why don't we just run down
and make love to one of them?"

911
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,463
And the older one says,

912
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:30,008
"Why don't we just walk down
and make love to all of them?"

913
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:31,885
Know what it is about?

914
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:34,012
It's about not rushing into things.

915
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,264
Sounds like it's about cow rape.

916
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:09,506
Let's go.

917
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:26,773
- They're on us. Keep down.

918
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:32,904
- Emma.
- I'm okay. Just take him out.

919
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,409
We're bouncing all over the place.
I can't get a shot off.

920
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:38,910
They were able to hit me.

921
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:52,632
Shit.

922
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:08,106
That. Was. Her. Violin. Arm.

923
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:13,403
What?

924
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,657
Will understands.

925
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:34,966
Where the hell are they?

926
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:36,885
I'm gonna call Barry.

927
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:38,845
This is bush league.

928
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:58,532
For the record, I hated the mixer.
